# Okay Technological Determinism, 2016

In Technoculture: The Key Concepts (2008), Debra Benita Shaw explains Technological determinism as the sense in which the requirements of machines dictate the rhythms and structure of both personal and social life. This project, by taking out of context elements of our daily interactions with machines, attempts to make people question these interactions and put things into perspective. Sentences said by machines and devices pop up in a dialog box and the only choice possible is to click on ‘OK’. This ‘no-choice’ interface is a metaphor of how we act while interacting with machines, we do not question, we embrace. Perhaps because of the immediacy of the society we are living in.
